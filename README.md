A simple demo of the idea in "Causal Leverage Density: A General Approach in Semantic Information", https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07335

## Data
You need some data. I downloaded UK Ordnance Survey data for the grid SZ (includes Isle of Wight) - https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/OpenRoads.

Download the GML 3 data and unzip to a folder in your environment (no registration needed).

This rough and ready script is hardwired to read that data file, so you should change it to accord with your local arrangements.

## Requirements
Runs in Python 3.9

See requirements.txt to install dependnecies.
