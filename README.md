# cld-networks
A simple demo of the idea in "Causal Leverage Density: A General Approach in Semantic Information", https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07335

## Data
You need some data. I downloaded UK Ordnance Survey data for the grid SZ (includes Isle of Wight) - https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/OpenRoads (no registration needed)

Download the GML 3 data and unzip to the data folder. This rough and ready script reads the road network data from a hardwired path, so please change it as needed.

## Requirements
Runs in Python 3.9

See requirements.txt to install dependnecies.
